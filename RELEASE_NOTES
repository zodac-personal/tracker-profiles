## New option `TAKE_SCREENSHOT_ON_ERROR`

Allows for a screenshot to be taken of the last page the execution is on if an error occurs when screenshotting a specific tracker. Mostly used for debugging, so default value is set to **false**.

## Planning for optional redaction items

I've refactored the way each tracker defines its 'sensitive' information, with a plan to allow users to select which information they want redacted (if any).
